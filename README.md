# Enigma_SuggestPassword
A basic frontend project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that simulates password suggestion using an Enigma-inspired encryption system. Users register with a username and password. If unsure about the password, they can use the "Suggest Password" button to generate a secure password automatically.

Project Files
register.html – Registration form page

register.js – Contains Enigma machine logic, password suggestion, and registration handling

style.css – General page styling

style1.css – Additional form styling

Features
Custom password suggestion using an Enigma rotor system

User registration with form validation (minimum 8 characters password)

How to Use
Open register.html in your browser.

Fill in a username.

Either type a password (minimum 8 characters) or click the Suggest Password button.

Click Register.

Notes
No server or backend is required; this project runs entirely in the browser.

Enigma logic implemented in register.js uses rotors, plugboard, and reflector configurations to generate randomized password suggestions.

This is the basic project for learning purpose only. It doesn't have any backend logic of storing password, it entirely works on the enigma configuration to suggest password.
